# Void Memingo Desktop

The native desktop application is built with Tauri 2, Rust, React, TypeScript, and Vite. It is separate from the existing \`void\` CLI so the current command-line release remains stable.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Rust stable
- Tauri 2 system dependencies for your operating system

On Debian/Ubuntu, install the Tauri Linux prerequisites before building. The official Tauri documentation lists the current WebKitGTK, GTK, and appindicator packages.

## Development

From this directory:

\`\`\`sh
npm install
npx tauri dev
\`\`\`

## Production build

\`\`\`sh
npm install
npx tauri build --bundles deb
\`\`\`

Tauri produces Linux `.deb`, Windows `.msi` / `.exe` (NSIS), and macOS `.dmg` bundles. CI builds Linux and Windows x86_64 plus macOS Intel and Apple Silicon variants.

## Workspace security

The Rust backend only reads and writes files within the folder selected by the user. It rejects parent-directory traversal and does not follow symbolic links while listing the workspace. The first milestone includes directory browsing, UTF-8 text editing, creating files, and saving changes.

## Integrated terminal

The bottom panel now uses a native cross-platform PTY through `portable-pty` and renders it with xterm.js. Shell sessions stay open between commands, stream output as it arrives, accept interactive input, support terminal resize signals, and can be interrupted with Ctrl+C. Multiple terminal sessions can be opened in tabs and closed independently.

The terminal starts in the selected workspace, but it is **not a security sandbox**: commands run with the current user's operating-system permissions and can access files and tools available to that user outside the workspace. Only run commands you understand and trust. Closing a terminal ends its shell session; child-process cleanup behavior depends on the operating system and shell.

Git operations, language services, build orchestration, and the debugger remain planned modules.
