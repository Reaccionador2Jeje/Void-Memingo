# Void Memingo Desktop

The native desktop application is built with Tauri 2, Rust, React, TypeScript, and Vite. It is separate from the existing \`void\` CLI so the current command-line release remains stable.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Rust stable
- Tauri 2 system dependencies for your operating system

On Debian/Ubuntu, install the Tauri Linux prerequisites before building. The official Tauri documentation lists the current WebKitGTK, GTK, and appindicator packages.

## Development

From this directory:

\`\`\`sh
npm install
npx tauri dev
\`\`\`

## Production build

\`\`\`sh
npm install
npx tauri build --bundles deb
\`\`\`

Tauri can produce Linux DEB/RPM/AppImage, Windows MSI/NSIS, and macOS DMG bundles. CI and release workflows select the native formats for each runner.

## Workspace security

The Rust backend only reads and writes files within the folder selected by the user. It rejects parent-directory traversal and does not follow symbolic links while listing the workspace. The first milestone includes directory browsing, UTF-8 text editing, creating files, and saving changes.

The integrated terminal, Git operations, language services, build orchestration, and debugger are planned modules; they are not represented as working features until implemented.
